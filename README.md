# smartpropertygrid-samples

This repository contains 2 sample apps that allow you to play with the capabilities of the [Smart PropertyGrid](https://visualhint.com/propertygrid) library.

Note that **Smart PropertyGrid** can be added to your own projects from [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VisualHint.SmartPropertyGrid/).

## Quickstart

This sample code is to be used along the "Quick Start Guide.pdf" found in the nuget package.

## PropertyGridShowRoom

This sample code uses 2 PropertyGrids to showcase what it's possible to do when filling a grid manually. All of the features you see can of course be achieved when using SelectedObject, only in a different manner.
